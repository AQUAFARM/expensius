            TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Cloud Messaging API key.

            To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

              https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=googlecloudmessaging&keyType=SERVER_SIDE&r=0.0.0.0/0

            Once you have your API key (which starts with â€œAIza...â€�), replace the "gcm.api.key" string in this file.
